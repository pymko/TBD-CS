# Squid Proxy Configuration

# Define the HTTP port
http_port 3128

# Basic Access Control - Allow only from specific networks
# Allow local network (replace with your network range)
acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24  # Allow access from your internal network

# Deny all other access
http_access deny all

# Allow access only to the defined networks
http_access allow localnet

# Authentication (Optional - can be added for user-based control)
# Uncomment to require authentication (ensure you have PAM or other auth methods configured)
# auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd
# auth_param basic children 5
# auth_param basic realm Squid Proxy Server
# acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
# http_access allow authenticated

# DNS security - prevent DNS poisoning
dns_v4_first on

# Logging - You should configure Squid logging to help with security auditing
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log squid
cache_log /var/log/squid/cache.log

# Limit request size to avoid buffer overflow attacks
request_size_max 10 MB

# Timeout settings (to prevent hanging connections)
request_timeout 30 seconds
connect_timeout 30 seconds
client_timeout 30 seconds

# Set up secure SSL handling
# Allow secure SSL connections and configure SSL certificates (optional)
https_port 3129 cert=/etc/squid/ssl_cert.pem key=/etc/squid/ssl_key.pem

# SSL Bump (for SSL interception, if needed)
# Uncomment the lines below for SSL Bump if your use case requires SSL interception
# ssl_bump peek all
# ssl_bump splice all
# ssl_bump terminate all

# Cache management
# Set cache size limits to prevent abuse
maximum_object_size_in_memory 8 MB

# Clear old cache files after some time
cache_store_log none

# Enable the squid process to use minimal privileges
# Squid should run under its own user and group (typically 'proxy')
cache_effective_user proxy
cache_effective_group proxy

# Deny all potentially dangerous or unnecessary HTTP methods
# This helps to reduce security risks such as XSS and other web application attacks
acl denied_methods method DELETE
acl denied_methods method TRACE

http_access deny denied_methods

# Enable logging of the HTTP response codes (optional)
log_ip_on_user_error on

# Disable ICMP (ping) responses from Squid, which can prevent DoS attacks
icmp_disabled on

# Enable firewall-like access control to prevent direct access to the proxy server from non-trusted hosts
# You can use iptables or UFW to restrict access to Squid's listening ports (3128, 3129, etc.)
